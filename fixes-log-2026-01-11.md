## Branch: FixedStorage (LocalStorage Implementation)

### Storage Implementation Change

- **File:** `src/pages/Home/Home.tsx`  
  **Lines:** 1-7, 45-110  
  **Fix:**
  - Removed JSON server dependency (`jobAPI` and `handleAPIError`)
  - Implemented localStorage for all data persistence
  - Replaced async API calls with synchronous localStorage operations
  - All CRUD operations now save to `localStorage` with key `jobs_{userId}`

### UI Features (Same as dev branch)

All UI improvements from the dev branch are included:
- ✅ Sorting functionality (by date, company, role, status)
- ✅ Hamburger menu for mobile
- ✅ Edit functionality with modal
- ✅ Success feedback messages
- ✅ Full mobile responsiveness
- ✅ Search and filter integration

### Key Differences from dev Branch

- **No JSON Server**: Uses localStorage instead of external API
- **Synchronous Operations**: No async/await needed
- **Self-contained**: Works without running json-server
- **User-specific Storage**: Each user's jobs stored separately using `jobs_{userId}` key

---

## Summary
- **dev branch**: Full JSON server integration with all UI fixes
- **FixedStorage branch**: localStorage implementation with same UI fixes (no JSON server dependency)
- All navigation, routing, filtering, searching, and sorting are fully functional and responsive in both branches
- Both branches successfully committed and pushed on 2026-01-11
